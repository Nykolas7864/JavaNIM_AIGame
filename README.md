# This repository holds the downloadable files for all code related to my team's game developed as a project for our class on AI. Within the files you can see the 4 different game modes that reflect the 4 different learning methods that were developed: CLS (Collective Learning Structure), NN (Neural Networks), MiniMax (Heuristical Analysis), and GA (Genetic Algorithms).
Within the files and our comments the game itself will be referred to as either SimpleNim or the "Wizard Frog" as that is the mascot and personality of our version of NIM.
In this version of NIM there are 15 marbles, the user plays against the AI. The user always goes first then swaps turns with the AI. Whoever draws the last marble loses. Each turn a player may choose to take 1, 2, or 3 marbles from the field. What makes the game challenging is figuring out how to trick the AI into taking the last marble, and the 4 different game modes dramatically affect how quickly the AI learns. To clearly demonstrate the growth of the AI opponent, it is necessary to play roughly 3-5 rounds regardless of which game mode is being used (should not take longer than 10 minutes).
There are further instructions on how to play once you run the game, and our code features plenty of comments to explain the thought process behind the development.
To play, please download SimpleNIM, find the folder of the game mode you would like to try, and build/run that project in an IDE that supports Java. Enjoy!
